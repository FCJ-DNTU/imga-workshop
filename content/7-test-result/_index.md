#### Test Result

In the main interface, we will select a sample image to test the result.

![7-test-result](/images/7-test-result/7-1-open-app-and-prepare-to-test.png)
![7-test-result](/images/7-test-result/7-2-choose-image.png)

After selecting, click **Scan**.

After a short wait, an Excel file will be downloaded.

![7-test-result](/images/7-test-result/7-4-save-excel-file.png)

Save the file and open it to view the results.

Go to the S3 Bucket responsible for storing images, which in this case is **imga-images**, to check.
