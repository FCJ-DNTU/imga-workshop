#### Create API Gateway

In the main interface:

- Search for `API Gateway`
- Select **API Gateway**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

- Here, we will create an API of type **HTTP**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

- Name: `imga-api`

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

We will create the routes later, so for now, skip this step.

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Next, the API Gateway needs to know which stage we are deploying. For now, we'll leave it as default. The API Gateway will append the stage name to the base URL.

Finally, review the configuration and click **Create**.
