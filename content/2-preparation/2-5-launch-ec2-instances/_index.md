#### Create and launch EC2 instances in the development environment
On the homepage:
  - Search for `EC2`
  - Select **EC2**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

On the EC2 page, click **Launch instance**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

In the setup section, we will configure the following information as shown in the image:
  - Name: `dev-ec2`
  - Application and OS Images: **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**
  - Instance type: **t2.micro**
  - Select a key pair if you already have one. If not, create one as follows:
    - Select **Create new key pair**
    - **Name**: `my-key`
    - **Type**: `RSA`
    - **Private key file**: `.pem`
    - Click **Create key pair**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**
**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

In the **Network settings** section, click **Edit**:
  - VPC: **development-vpc**
  - Subnet: choose the public subnet
  - Auto-assign public IP: Enable
  - Firewall:
    - Select **Select existing security group**
    - Choose the SG **dev-ec2-sg** we created earlier
  - Finally, click **Launch instance**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

#### Create and launch EC2 instances in the production environment
In the setup section, configure the following details as shown in the image:
  - Name: `prod-ec2`
  - Application and OS Images: **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**
  - Instance type: **t3.small**
  - Select a key pair if you already have one. If not, create one as follows:
    - Select **Create new key pair**
    - **Name**: `my-key`
    - **Type**: `RSA`
    - **Private key file**: `.pem`
    - Click **Create key pair**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**
**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

In the **Network settings** section, click **Edit**:
  - VPC: **production-vpc**
  - Subnet: choose the private subnet
  - Auto-assign public IP: Disable
  - Firewall:
    - Select **Select existing security group**
    - Choose the SG **prod-ec2-sg** we created earlier
  - Finally, click **Launch instance**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Lastly, I will check if both EC2 instances are running.

#### Test the connection
In theory, with the configurations we've set up, the EC2 in the development environment should be able to SSH into the EC2 in the production environment. Letâ€™s test this.

First:
  - Select **dev-ec2**
  - Copy the public IPv4

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Open MobaXterm or VSCode (we are using MobaXterm for this tutorial):
  - Start a new session
  - With the following details:
    - Remote host: public IPv4
    - Specify username: `ec2-user`
    - In **Advanced SSH settings**, check **Use private key**, and select the key-pair we downloaded earlier.
  - Click **Ok**

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Next, I will upload the `.pem` file to the EC2 instance using MobaXterm to SSH into the production EC2 instance (we are using the same key-pair for both EC2s in this tutorial).

In the **Instances** view:
  - Select `prod-ec2`
  - Copy the private IPv4 address of this EC2

**INSERT IMAGE HERE**

Enter the following command in the terminal:

```
chmod 400 <your-key>.pem
ssh -i <your-key>.pem ec2-user@<private ipv4>
```

And we got the result:

This confirms that the setup steps we followed were correct. In the next section, we will explore how our system is deployed.
