To allow an EC2 instance in the production environment to download packages, libraries, software, and Docker images stored in ECR, the VPC of the production environment must have a NAT Gateway. This allows EC2 instances in that network to access the internet and download the necessary resources via the NAT Gateway.

#### Setting up the NAT Gateway

In the VPC interface:

- Select **NAT gateways**
- Click **Create NAT gateway**

We will configure the VPC with the following details:

- Name: `nat-gw`
- Subnet: select the public subnet that was set up earlier
- Connectivity type: **Public**
- Elastic IP allocation ID: click **Allocate Elastic IP** to quickly create one
- Click **Create NAT gateway**

Now we will add a new route in the routing table that is connected to the private subnet where the EC2 instance is located. This route will go to the NAT Gateway.

- Select the private subnet
- Add a route with the following details:
  - Destination: `0.0.0.0/0`
  - Target: the **NAT Gateway** we just created
- Save changes

Now, this private subnet can access the internet through the NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway. We can verify this in the **Resource map** tab under **Your VPCs**.

#### Verifying the connection

In theory, with the configuration weâ€™ve done so far, the EC2 instance in the development environment should be able to SSH into the EC2 instance in the production environment. Let's test this.

First:

- Select **dev-ec2**
- Copy the public IPv4

Open MobaXterm or VSCode. In this guide, we are using MobaXterm.

- Start a new session
- Enter the following details:
  - Remote host: public IPv4
  - Specify username: `ec2-user`
  - In **Advanced SSH settings**, check **Use private key** and select the key-pair we downloaded in the previous step.
- Click **Ok**

Next, we will upload the `.pem` file to the EC2 instance using MobaXterm to establish an SSH connection to the EC2 instance in the production environment (both EC2 instances are using the same key-pair).

In the Instances interface:

- Select `imga-server`
- Copy the internal IPv4 address of this EC2 instance

![2-image](/images/2-preparation/2-7-10-upload-key.png)
![2-image](/images/2-preparation/2-7-11-copy-prod-ec2-private-ip.png)

Enter the following command in the command line:

```bash
chmod 400 <your-key>.pem
ssh -i <your-key>.pem ec2-user@<private ipv4>
```

And we get the following result:

With this, the configuration steps we have completed are correct. In the next section, we will explore how our system is deployed.
