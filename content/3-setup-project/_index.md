We will simulate working on a project where the application’s source code is stored on GitHub. In this case, you’ll need to "fork" the repository from the main project into your personal GitHub account to continue practicing.

In this section, we will clone the project from Github onto the EC2 instance in the development environment, along with Docker, so we can package the project’s source code and push it to ECR. This will allow us to deploy the web server inside the EC2 instance in the production environment.
