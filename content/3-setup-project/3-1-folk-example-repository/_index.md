#### Creating a repository on GitHub

In practice, our applications will be managed by source control managers like GitHub, GitLab, or any other version control system. For this guide, we will clone a sample project as if it were our own project.

In this example, we will use GitHub. You can access the project source code at this link: `https://github.com/FCJ-DNTU/imga`.

On the screen, click the **Fork** button and fill in the necessary details.

Then, click **Create fork**, and now we have a copy of this project in our GitHub account.

This project will be cloned to your local machine and the EC2 instance in the development environment for development tasks.
